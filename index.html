                <name>Shivam Singh</name>
              </p>
              <p>I am a Computer Science Graduate Student at <a href="https://uta.edu">The University of Texas at Arlington</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Ever since I was a little kid, software development has been my passion. I still remember sitting in front of a Pentium-I computer, coding to build a calculator in the BASIC language, making it fully operational for the very first time. As I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted, just by typing in these funny little symbols, limited only by my own imagination and ingenuity. Throughout middle and high school, I latched on to any ideas for projects I could get, moving from “Hello World” all the way to a simple “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” game simulator, with dozens of projects in between. I learned C, then C++ and Java, learning through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.
                <br>
                <br>
                This passion carried me through my education at JIIT, where there were more resources available to me than I ever could have imagined as a kid. I studied new languages, algorithms, compilers, higher mathematics, all with pretty much the same fascination that drove me as a kid. And it was here that I learned truly how much there was yet to learn.
                <br>
                <br>
                After my undergrad, I started my own start-up with a good product idea because I love to dig into customer problems and solve them with modern technology. During that phase, I stepped forward to take other major roles and responsibilities - Management and Legal aspects. I have enjoyed these roles and gained new experience in product management and marketing, technical sales, engineering, and strategy. During this journey I learned a couple of things about myself:
                <br>
                <br>
                -I excel at the execution of big ideas with given constraints
                <br>
                -My gut instinct is good but I seek data for my decisions
                <br>
                -I can align, lean, and grow an efficient product team
                <br>
                -I stay calm when faced with adversity
                <br>
                -I focus on making high-quality decisions
                <br>
                <br>
                Basically, I educate, refine, and drive myself to be a better person. This carried me for my master’s, where I exposed myself to the General AI world and learned a lot of new concepts:
                <br>
                -Deep learning on Graphs for Computer Vision - CNN, RNN, & GNN
                <br>
                -Natural Language Processing
                <br>
                -Reinforcement learning - Dyna-Q & Deep-Q learning
                <br>
                <br>
                I have dedicated my life towards growing companies in the field of technology incubation and commercialization to bring out the best in others and strongly believe in collaborative work.
                <br>
                <br>
                I am open to learning about your story and see if there is something common that we can work towards. Let’s connect!
